# Portainer - Docker Management UI

## What is This?

Portainer is a simple web-based user interface that lets you see and manage all the Docker containers running on your system. It's a much more user-friendly way to check logs, restart services, or inspect volumes than using the command line.

## How to Access It

1.  Open your browser and go to **`https://localhost:9443`**.
    
2.  Your browser will likely show a security warning because Portainer uses a self-signed SSL certificate. This is safe to ignore. Click **"Advanced"** and then **"Proceed to localhost"**.
    
3.  The first time you open it, Portainer will ask you to create an **admin user**. Set a username and a strong password.
    
4.  On the next screen, it will ask you which Docker environment you want to manage. Select **"Docker"** and click **"Connect"**.
    

You will then see a dashboard with a list of all your running containers.
